This is a transmitter for 433 MHz On-Off Keyed/Amplitude Shift Keyed
remote control signals.

FIXME: stretch goal is to also have it receive and decode signals from
other 433 MHz OOK remotes, so it can clone them.

Built on a Seeed Studios XIAO RP2040 and a cheap-ass 433 MHz OOK
transmitter from Ebay.
